I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Indiana University Bloomington, under the supervision of Prof. XiaoFeng Wang(https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/xw7/) and Prof. Haixu Tang(https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/hatang/).

Before joining Indiana University, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Software and Theory from Peking University in January 2023, advised by Prof. Zhonghai Wu(https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1268-836X). During my doctoral studies, I also had the enriching opportunity to serve as a visiting scholar at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security from 2019 to 2020.
